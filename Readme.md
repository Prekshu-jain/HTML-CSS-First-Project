So this is the first attempt at our project. We are making a landing site for the practise and maybe 
later there would be updates or some changes in it. 

So create a folder with any name and inside the folder make a folder path like this- 

``` 
---assets
------css
---------style.css
------img
---------images
------js

---index.html

```
